# How to adjust opacity

In this tutorial you will learn how to adjust a layer's opacity in QGIS so that you can "see underneath" or through the layer to the map data below.

1. In the [QGIS](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/download/) layer list, right-click the layer you would like to adjust the opacity for.

2. Select `Properties`.

3. In the properties menu, select `Legend`.

4. Move `Opacity slider` from `Available widgets` to `Used widgets` by selecting `Opacity slider` and clicking the right-hand arrow `Add selected widgets`. 
> The text "opacity slider" should move over into the Used widgets box. 

5. Select `OK`.

6. An opacity slider should now appear in your layer list underneath the layer. You can slide this to make the layer more or less transparent.
