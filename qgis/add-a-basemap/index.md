## Tips
- To add other styles of basemap not included by default in the QGIS install, you can run a Google search about the latest QGIS plugins for basemaps. Here is a [2018 article about using basemap plugin Quick Map Services](https://opengislab.com/blog/2018/4/15/add-basemaps-in-qgis-30) for additional basemap styles.
